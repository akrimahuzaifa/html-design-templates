i have a website project, design/developed it for me (should look modern, premium, converting and have aesthetics so feels catchy).

put some effort. Developed the complete aesthetic modern looking landing and other pages with everything proper. Take your time and plan first take every edge cases to process and then start building. like i want results that i can say wow you did a great job. Please do the hard work, give it a look that aspire other people by looking at the site and client say, i can that you put great effort in the website building it, every detailing, beautification, things like that. Don't do it like, it looks not interested in developing. Put some effort and that come up good. we can skip the back-end part for now to save it for later and focus only on building the front-end first, so we have something to show to the client instantly. So bottom line is, create a stunning, modern website for Happy2Clean that will truly impress my client. Plan this carefully and build something exceptional.
